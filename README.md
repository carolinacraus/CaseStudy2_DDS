## Introduction 

Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over  competition, companies leverage data science for talent management. Identifying and predicting employee turnover is one of the first applications of data science for talent management. This analysis uses existing employee historical data to predict attrition using different classification techniques.
